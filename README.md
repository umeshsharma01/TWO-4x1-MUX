# TWO-4x1-MUX
A design using two 4×1 multiplexers is commonly employed to construct larger multiplexing circuits such as an 8×1 multiplexer or to perform parallel data selection.
In this configuration each 4×1 multiplexer selects one input from a group of four using two select lines.
The outputs of the two 4×1 multiplexers can then be connected to an additional selection stage typically a 2×1 multiplexer or equivalent logic which chooses between the two intermediate outputs based on a higher-order select line.
This hierarchical approach simplifies circuit design, reduces complexity, and improves scalability. Using two 4×1 multiplexers allows designers to build flexible and modular data routing systems commonly used in processors, communication systems, and digital electronics
